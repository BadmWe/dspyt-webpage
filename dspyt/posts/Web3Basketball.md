## What Web3Basketball does

Web3Basketball Dapp introduces users to the sport of Basketball as well as contains an item store to track and ledger the delivery of basketball equipment. Each real equipment item is ledgered via a digital one with a smart contract logic system in place to determine the demand and track items. When delivery is completed the DApp NFTs should be exchanged for the physical items.

A great win for the producers is to save on costs with improved inventory tracking and demand management. Web3Basketball DApp succeeds where off-chain software-ledger system products fail because they may go out of service, need updates, and crash with data losses. Web3Basketball DApp is a very low-cost business systems management product/tool.

While competing software-based ledgering products carry monthly and or annual base fees, the only new costs accrued by the business utilizing the DApp are among new contract deployments. A new contract for a new batch of items only is needed every few months based on demand and delivery schedule.

## How we built Web3Basketball

We built the application using JavaScript, NextJS, React, Tailwind CSS, Polygon and ChainLink. The application is hosted on Vercel. Meanwhile, the IPFS data is stored using web3.storage and nft.storage with car file extension.

We have utilized Price Feed from ChainLink oracle in the smart contract to calculate the fair price of the items in our market place. In particular we estimated Ethereum price in USD.

## Interesting information

One of the most popular sports in the world is basketball. This is primarily because it is one of the most engrossing games ever created. Millions of people watch the sport, and thousands of supporters attend games. Accordingly, the National Basketball Association (NBA) is one of the world's most fiercely competitive leagues.

The NBA is a well-known basketball league that attracts viewers from all over the world. The world's best basketball players compete on this platform. There are a lot of thrilling plays and moments, including dunks, posterizations, blocks, and buzzer-beaters.

Thankfully, the NBA's governing body made it possible for everyone to watch, whether it be live on television or a basketball court. Real Research had therefore undertaken a study to ascertain NBA viewership. The study was conducted between December 24 and December 26, 2020.

## Highlights

1. 77% of those surveyed say they watch basketball matches live or on television.
2. Nearly 70% of people play basketball and identify as basketball aficionados.
3. The majority of poll respondents are at least somewhat familiar with basketball regulations.
4. About 27% regularly follow and watch basketball.
5. More than 30% of respondents said that the Los Angeles Lakers were their favorite team.

A typical NBA season involves 82 games for each team. The playoffs are open to eight teams from each of the two leagues. The Nine-Ten Game winner will play the Seven-Eight Game loser in a play-in game. The winner of that game will therefore receive the conference's eighth seed in the playoffs. There are consequently over 100 NBA games.

When asked if they follow NBA games, 24% responded that they "always" do so. Conversely, 23% said they "often" follow the games, 29% said they "sometimes," 13% said they "rarely," and 11% said they never follow any NBA games.

## **Los Angeles Lakers: The Favorite Team of NBA Fans**

There are numerous teams, but only a select number are receiving media attention. This is a typical scenario in practically all sports. Popular clubs are often those that have consistently performed well and kept their rankings at the top. They become many fans' favorite teams as a result. It doesn't necessarily follow that others aren't doing well, either.

The majority of respondents' (30%) preferred team is the Los Angeles Lakers. The Philadelphia 76ers are in third place, followed by the Atlanta Hawks (12%) and Portland Trail (13%). Numerous survey respondents' lists of preferred teams included the remaining 26 teams as well. However, 7% of respondents admitted that they have no preferred team.
