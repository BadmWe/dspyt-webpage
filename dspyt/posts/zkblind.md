We are excited to announce the release of ZkBlind NextJs, a cutting-edge project that leverages the power of zero-knowledge tools and protocols to provide unparalleled anonymity security. ZkBlind NextJs is a solution that allows individuals to authenticate their employment with a specific company without revealing their actual identity.

## How ZkBlind NextJs Works

ZkBlind NextJs provides a seamless process for individuals to authenticate their employment using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use ZkBlindNextJs:

1. **Send Email:** Users can send an email from their corporate account to their personal account, including their Ethereum (ETH) address and its corresponding signature in the email body.

2. **Generate ZKP:** After downloading the email from the personal account, users can use the provided script to generate the Zero-Knowledge Proof.

3. **Registration & Validation:** Users can fill out a form on zkBlind with their ZKP, email suffix (indicating their company), ETH address, and user ID. ZkBlind NextJs will validate the submitted information and register user details in a smart contract upon successful validation.

4. **Usage:** Once registered, users can log in to ZkBlind NextJs with their ETH wallet and post messages. Despite being verified as an employee of a specific company (via their email suffix), their individual identity remains anonymous.

## Getting Started with ZkBlind NextJs

To get started with ZkBlind NextJs, ensure that your node version is 15 or above. Run `npm i` to install the necessary dependencies. Then, run the development server using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`. Open `http://localhost:3000` with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`, and the page auto-updates as you edit the file. API routes can be accessed on `http://localhost:3000/hello`, and this endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`. The project uses `next/font` to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

ZkBlind NextJs can easily be deployed as a Next.js app using the Vercel Platform, by the creators of Next.js.

For more detailed information, and to access the ZkBlindNextJs project, please visit the official repository: [ZkBlind NextJs GitHub](https://github.com/ZkBlind/ZkBlindNextJs).

We are thrilled to offer this innovative solution that prioritizes privacy, security, and authentication for individuals. Join us in leveraging the power of Zero-Knowledge Proofs with ZkBlind NextJs.

Stay tuned for updates and features as we continue to enhance the capabilities of ZkBlind NextJs.
