In the Dynamic Realm of Digital Public Goods:
Since its establishment in 2017, Gitcoin has been a driving force, dedicated to the creation and sustenance of crucial digital public goods. It has played a central role in nurturing a vibrant community actively contributing to the progression of these essential resources. In this discourse, we explore the profound significance of public goods, the role of Gitcoin Grants, and the revolutionary concept of Quadratic Funding (QF).

## Decoding Public Goods

At the core of Gitcoin's mission is a deep understanding of public goods. Defined as non-excludable and non-rivalrous resources, public goods, such as clean air, benefit society universally. They play a vital role in creating better outcomes for both the privileged and those in poverty. In our digital era, Open Source Software (OSS) emerges as a crucial public good, providing the digital infrastructure that is the backbone of our technological landscape.

## Why Public Goods Matter

Public goods are essential for societal progress, addressing basic needs and fostering equal opportunities. Libraries, as an example, can educate populations indiscriminately, assuming equal access. Gitcoin recognizes that the majority of the value consumed in the world is derived through public goods, making funding their existence and accessibility paramount to societal advancement.

In the digital age, OSS becomes a linchpin. Despite providing billions of dollars in economic value, OSS authors often struggle to make a living solely from their work due to the lack of a viable business model. Gitcoin envisions a world where thousands of OSS developers can quit their corporate jobs and focus on OSS, contributing to the collective digital infrastructure.

## How Gitcoin Grants Work

Understanding the importance of public goods and OSS, Gitcoin employs various funding mechanisms, with direct grant programs being a common approach. This involves committees reviewing applications and directly funding projects that align with their goals. However, for larger communities like Ethereum, Gitcoin introduces the concept of Quadratic Funding (QF).

QF occurs in rounds, typically every quarter for Gitcoin, where the community actively contributes to projects they believe should be funded. A matching partner then matches these contributions, emphasizing community sentiment over the sheer dollar value raised. QF is chosen for its democratic, scalable, and community-involving nature.

Quadratic Funding excels in:

- Democracy: Allowing everyday community members to influence funding decisions by contributing to projects.
- Community Involvement: Enabling communities to co-fund projects alongside matching funds holders, ensuring a collective effort.
- Scalability: Reviewing hundreds of grants per quarter compared to the limitations of centralized grant teams.
- Influencer Neutrality: Allowing influencers to advocate for projects without having unilateral influence; the community decides on funding.

## Choosing Gitcoin

Gitcoin, having facilitated over 20 million dollars in funding, stands as the largest experiment in Quadratic Funding for digital public goods. The Grants Rounds, determined through community governance votes, channel funds to key categories essential for building the web3 ecosystem. The success of Gitcoin Grants, deploying over 35 million dollars in the last four years, underscores its effectiveness as a coordination layer connecting projects to contributors.

The community-driven nature of Gitcoin Grants extends beyond mere funding; it is a manifestation of a collective mission to build and fund digital public goods. Gitcoin has been instrumental in the success of notable projects like Uniswap, 1inch Exchange, and development for EIP-1559, all of which started as Gitcoin Grants.

## Gitcoin's Vision for the Future

Gitcoin envisions moving beyond categorical fund distribution and exploring new funding mechanisms like retroactive public goods funding. This approach aims to offer larger lump sum payments to those contributing to vital infrastructure projects, acknowledging the often-thankless job of building essential digital resources.

As public goods funding and coordination spaces advance, Gitcoin anticipates witnessing more novel ways to reward contributors within and across communities. The introduction of retroactive public goods funding is a testament to Gitcoin's commitment to recognizing and rewarding the invaluable contributions of those building the digital infrastructure.

## Gitcoin Grants' Success Stories

Gitcoin, through its Grants Rounds, has facilitated over 35 million dollars in funding towards Digital Public Goods in the last four years. This success is not solely attributed to Gitcoin but is a collective achievement of the community. Gitcoin Grants serves as a coordination layer, connecting projects to contributors and providing a platform for impactful collaborations.

## Embracing Novel Funding Mechanisms

Gitcoin is excited about emerging funding mechanisms, such as retroactive public goods funding. This approach offers a unique opportunity for those building essential infrastructure to be recognized and rewarded for their often-overlooked contributions. As the space continues to evolve, Gitcoin anticipates more innovative ways to reward and recognize contributors within and across communities.

In conclusion, Gitcoin Grants has become a pillar in the Ethereum ecosystem, and the team envisions developing additional decentralized protocols to advance the coordination of communities in the future.
