We are excited to announce the release of [EVM Explorer](https://evmexplorer.com/), a powerful, open-source web interface designed to streamline the exploration and analysis of blockchain data. Utilizing the BlockScout API and viem library, EVM Explorer enables users to delve into transaction patterns and user behavior across multiple EVM chains.

## What is EVM Explorer?

[EVM Explorer](https://evmexplorer.com/), a custom open-source web interface to collect data with the help of BlockScout API and viem library to explore transaction patterns and user behavior.

EVM Explorer is a versatile tool that simplifies the process of exploring and analyzing smart contracts. With its intuitive interface, users can access detailed information and statistics about smart contracts, token balances, transactions, and more.

## Discover and track EVM smart contract data

Search, Discover, and Track contracts by their address on 8 EVM chains: Ethereum Mainnet, Optimism, Base, Mode Network, Zora, Redstone, Polygon, and Arbitrum.

![Choose Network](images/posts/evmexplorer/choosenetwork.webp)

Simply paste the contract address, select a network, and click the Submit button to view transactions.

After you click the submit button, you will be redirected to a page related to an address.

## Blockchain Address page

![Address Data](images/posts/evmexplorer/addressdata.webp)

The address page displays the header with a balance in Eth token as well as an address hash and an ens name.

Users can view the 50 latest transactions associated with an address, including their receiver, sender, contract method called, eth or matic value, fees, and the gas used.

- Fees: display gas fee cost in USD.
- Transaction Method and Type: colored to reflect the mix of coin transfer, token transfer, and contract call.
- Transaction Hash
- Transaction Block
- Transaction Timestamp
- Gas Used
- Gas Price
- Transaction Value in USD
- Result

In addition, for smart contracts aggregate data should also be available:

- Number of Transactions
- Number of Token Transfers
- Average Gas per Transactions
- Gas Usage

For example, [Optimism (OP) governance token page](https://evmexplorer.com/contracts/optimism/0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000042):

## Transaction page

The transaction page contains Block number, transaction type, receiver, contract method call details, sender, gas used in USD, and token transfers details.

## Blocks page

On the Blocks page, users can access essential information such as the block miner and date, providing insight into the blockchain's operations. For example, [20,898,767 Ethereum mainnet block](https://evmexplorer.com/blocks/mainnet/20898767) is displayed below.

Additionally, aggregate data is prominently displayed, including the total Gas Usage, Transactions count, and Average Gas per Transaction, offering a comprehensive overview of the block's activity. Furthermore, the page showcases detailed transaction data with information on the receiver, sender, gas used, and transaction value in USD. Users can also track metrics such as the Number of Transactions, Number of Token Transfers, Average Gas per Transaction, and Gas Usage, enabling a deeper understanding of the block's transactions and network performance.

## Explorer Page

[Explorer Page](https://evmexplorer.com/explorer) contains links to popular sets of smart contracts:

- [AAVE](https://evmexplorer.com/explore/Aave)
- [Compound Finance](https://evmexplorer.com/explore/Compound)
