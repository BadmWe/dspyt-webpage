## How to bypass CAPTCHA in python

To begin with, we install the Python library necessary to interact with the 2CAPTHCHA captcha solving software:

```bash
pip3 install 2captcha-python
```

Now we can solve the captcha in Python. We import the installed library and initialize a `TwoCaptcha` instance.

```python
from twocaptcha import TwoCaptcha

PRIVATE_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
solver = TwoCaptcha(PRIVATE_KEY)
```

Additionally, there are a maximum of 7 arguments that we can pass to the `TwoCaptcha` class as kwargs.

```python
config = {
            'server':           '2captcha.com',
            'apiKey':           'YOUR_API_KEY',
            'softId':            444,
            'callback':         'https://website.app/result-receiver',
            'defaultTimeout':    120,
            'recaptchaTimeout':  600,
            'pollingInterval':   10,
        }
solver = TwoCaptcha(**config)
```

- `Server` argument - API server for the captcha solving software
- `apiKey` argument - your api key
- `softId` argument - your software ID obtained after publishing in [2captcha software catalog](https://2captcha.com?from=16036084software/add)
