Our focus remained on the development of ethereum smart contract explorer, which is a comprehensive tool designed to facilitate the exploration of ethereum contracts and their associated data.

The objective of this project is to offer users a user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of exploring ethereum smart contracts.

This week we deployed the application on vercel available at: [https://next-js-explorer-sigma.vercel.app/](https://next-js-explorer-sigma.vercel.app/).

## Ethereum smart contract explorer features

Here are some of the key features of ethereum smart contract explorer:

- Contract Search: The application allows users to search for Ethereum contracts by their address. Once a contract is found, users can view its details such as the contract's ABI and ethereum balance.

- Transactions: Users can view the latest transactions associated with a particular contract, including transaction hashes for a receiver, a sender, and gas amount used.

- Current state: The application also displays all the current states for a contract, along with their parameters.

Overall, the Ethereum Contract Explorer simplifies the process of exploring Ethereum contracts and their associated data. It provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to quickly and easily access important information about contracts and their transactions, events, and functions.
