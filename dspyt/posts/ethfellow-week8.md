Our focus remained on the development of Ethereum Contract Explorer, which is a comprehensive tool designed to facilitate the exploration of Ethereum contracts and their associated data. The objective of this project is to offer users a user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of exploring Ethereum contracts.

This week we deployed the application on vercel available at: [https://next-js-explorer-sigma.vercel.app/](https://next-js-explorer-sigma.vercel.app/).

Here are some of the key features of the Ethereum Contract Explorer:

Contract Search: The application allows users to search for Ethereum contracts by their address. Once a contract is found, users can view its details such as the contract's ABI.

Transactions: Users can view the latest transactions associated with a particular contract, including their receiver, sender, and gas used.

Current state: The application also displays all the current states for a contract, along with their parameters.

Overall, the Ethereum Contract Explorer simplifies the process of exploring Ethereum contracts and their associated data. It provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to quickly and easily access important information about contracts and their transactions, events, and functions.
