Sei Ecosystem is the epicenter of technological advancement, bringing together creative minds and industry leaders to drive the future of Sei's blockchain technology.

To add SEI on Metamask, you can use the Chainlist website to easily add SEI on Metamask, utilizing the information available at [Chainlist SEI](https://chainlist.org/?chain=713715&search=SEI).

Additionally, to explore the SEI blockchain and its transactions, you can use the SEI Block Explorer available at [seitrace.com](https://seitrace.com).

## Obtain SEI through KuCoin

To withdraw tokens from KuCoin to the native SEI address, you need to follow the steps below:

1. First, obtain your native SEI address. You can connect your EVM address to a native SEI address by visiting [this link](https://app.sei.io/) and following the instructions provided.
2. With your native SEI address, proceed to KuCoin and initiate the withdrawal process. Paste your native SEI address as the destination for the withdrawal.

## Swapping on SEI

For swapping tokens on SEI, you can utilize DragonSwap, a decentralized automated market maker (AMM) native to the Sei Network. You can access the platform by visiting the [DragonSwap website](https://dragonswap.app/swap).

## Bridging to SEI

If you are interested in bridging tokens, you can explore Stargate Finance, which offers a service for bridging tokens. You can visit the platform through the [Stargate Finance bridge](https://stargate.finance/bridge).

## Recent Developments

The Sei ecosystem has been actively expanding and providing opportunities through various initiatives, including the Sei Creator Fund. The Sei Creator Fund, with a significant 10 million in funding, has been supporting projects and individuals contributing to Sei's creator ecosystem. Recently, Round #2 of the fund has been announced, focusing on [Creative Media and IP Development](https://blog.sei.io/sei-creator-fund-round-2-creative-media-and-ip-development), offering a 250,000 matching pool to support relevant projects and individuals. This round aims to encourage consistent content creation and establish a strong brand presence within the ecosystem.

To apply for the fund, individuals are required to create a profile on [Builder](https://builder.gitcoin.co/#/chains/1329/rounds/9) (if not already done) and then apply on Gitcoinâ€™s Grants Stack. The fund utilizes Quadratic Funding (QF) through Gitcoin Grants Stack, which is a crowd-funding mechanism where community members make donations that act as votes on where to allocate funds. The approach rewards projects based on the number of people who have donated, capturing community needs and incentivizing smaller contributors. Moreover, the Sei Foundation has partnered with Karma GAP, requiring grantees to share their progress and explain how they utilized funds via milestone tracking to be eligible for future rounds.

In addition to the Creator Fund, other developments within the Sei ecosystem include the successful seed funding of Filament, a hybrid decentralized exchange (DEX) for derivatives on the Sei Network. Furthermore, Sei has launched the Sei GG gaming competition and announced Creator Fund Rounds #3 and #4, indicating a vibrant and expanding ecosystem.

Overall, these developments highlight the commitment of the Sei ecosystem to foster innovation and development, leveraging various funding and support mechanisms to encourage participation and contribution from the community.
