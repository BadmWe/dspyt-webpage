In the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency, there is a need for better tools to explore the data on the network. With the increasing popularity of Ethereum, it is important to have a tool that allows users to explore the Ethereum network and its contracts in an easy and intuitive way. This is why I have been working on developing an open source contract explorer for Ethereum.

## Ethereum explorer project aims

The project aims to provide users with the ability to search for contracts based on various criteria such as address, transaction hash, contract name, etc., view detailed information about each contract such as the code, deployed transactions, storage and execution costs, etc., and monitor the network activity of a contract over a period of time.

## Mentor's Advice

This week I had a call with Jordan Ellis from Polywrap who provided me with valuable insight into contract explorers in the open-source ecosystem. He outlined the key detail of explorers as providing block data and transaction data and suggested working on collaborating with open-source explorers such as Blockscout. He also provided me with some helpful resources such as TryEthernal and Ethresear which are useful for finding related smart contracts on different networks.

## Project's progress

I have also added search functionality to my project and now it is able to search for contracts based on address. Additionally, I have fixed the Ethplorer API by providing a freekey in the API field. I have also started working on developing the detailed information view for each contract.

## Next week plans

In the next week, I will continue developing the detailed information view and improve the user interface for the project. Currently facing significant obstacles with Tailwind not behaving as expected from docs. I will also be looking into integrating more APIs from other projects such as Etherscan and Blockscout in order to get more data about contracts and improve my projectâ€™s features.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I am excited to be working on developing an open source contract explorer for Ethereum. This project will provide users with the ability to search for contracts based on various criteria, view detailed information about each contract, and monitor the network activity of a contract over a period of time. I am looking forward to continuing to work on this project and integrating more APIs from other projects in order to improve the features and functionality of my project.
