## Guidelines for style and standards of excellence

We maintain stringent standards when it comes to the caliber of articles we release. Don't be disheartened if your submissions are declined! Please return to submit new content at our platform at a later time. Here are some recommendations that will assist you as you create narratives for us to approve.

1. Cite all your sources
2. Incorporate relevant data and quotes as necessary
3. Avoid creating daily or unstructured 'stream of consciousness' blog entries
4. Compose a minimum of 350 words
5. Introduce original data visualizations as required
6. Do not directly link to images; instead, add images to the directory
7. Steer clear of clickbait headlines
8. Do not make typographical errors
9. Construct a descriptive, evergreen URL path (filename) for your post
10. Implement code blocks, and take advantage of our support for syntax highlighting in popular programming languages
11. You may incorporate tasteful links back to your personal site and projects
12. It is acceptable to include a one-sentence call-to-action for your product at the conclusion of your piece
13. Avoid including any affiliate links
14. Cross-posting is only permissible if you set the canonical URL on those platforms to direct to the DSPYT-CodeVerse post
15. Thoroughly review and edit your article, then review it once more for good measure
