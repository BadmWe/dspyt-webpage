3. Avoid creating daily or unstructured 'stream of consciousness' blog entries
4. Compose a minimum of 350 words

7. Steer clear of clickbait headlines
8. Donâ€™t make typographical errors
9. Construct a descriptive, evergreen URL path (filename) for your post
10. Implement code blocks, and take advantage of our support for syntax highlighting in popular programming languages
