DspytAI provides an intuitive and easy to use platform for Uniswap traders looking to gain an edge on the market. Our browser-based frontend gives users the ability to determine price averages for any ERC20 contract through the combination of a machine learning model and the Graph. We shifted the data 10 steps ahead to generate more medium term predictions. Uniswap graphql schemas appear to operate only in part. tokenDayData is the only available schema to obtain the more granular data. We have generated predictions with LSTM and a pipeline with sklearn. We tested the Flask python api with vercel and it works very conveniently for data processing and further integration into the project.
