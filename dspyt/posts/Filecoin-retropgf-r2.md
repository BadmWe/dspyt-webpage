The Filecoin community is launching **FIL-RetroPGF-2**, a grant initiative aimed at recognizing and rewarding impactful contributions within the Filecoin ecosystem. This round will focus on projects that have demonstrated significant impact between April and September 2024. Through a structured, multi-stage process, participants will have the opportunity to showcase their work, receive feedback, and potentially secure funding.

## Key Stages of FIL-RetroPGF Round 2

### Stage 1: Project Showcase (September 30 – October 14, 2024)

During this initial stage, participants can present their projects to highlight the impact they’ve made. The objective is to gain visibility and feedback before the formal application stage. Projects should submit brief descriptions on the designated GitHub thread, including:

- **Project Name**
- **Category**
- **50-word Description**
- **URL** (e.g., project website or GitHub repo)

Sharing your submission on social media with hashtags **(#filretropgf #filecoin)** is encouraged, as increased visibility can influence badgeholders when they evaluate projects.

### Stage 2: Application Intake (October 14 – November 4, 2024)

This phase requires participants to submit a detailed application form, which will be reviewed by badgeholders to assess the project’s impact during the evaluation period (April to September 2024). Clear and thorough documentation of contributions is essential.

### Stage 3: Badgeholder Evaluation & Voting (November 11 – November 25, 2024)

Badgeholders will assess each submission based on its overall impact on the Filecoin ecosystem. They will allocate funding to projects in accordance with these evaluations.

### Stage 4: Vote Aggregation, Funding Allocation, and Distribution (December 2024)

The final stage will aggregate votes and allocate funding to projects based on the badgeholders' decisions. Approved projects will receive their funds through DRIPs starting in December.

## Why Participate?

This initiative offers more than just funding. It serves as a platform to enhance visibility and receive feedback from the Filecoin community, helping teams refine their work and further contribute to the ecosystem. It’s an opportunity to showcase contributions and engage deeply with the Filecoin network.

## Ready to Get Started?

Keep an eye out for application guidelines, and on September 30, head over to the **[GitHub thread](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/714)** to submit your project details and share your work on social media to increase engagement!
