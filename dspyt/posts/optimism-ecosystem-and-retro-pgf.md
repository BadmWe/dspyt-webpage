The Optimism Collective is a thriving community dedicated to building an economy that empowers its members and rewards them for their contributions. The ecosystem is focused on enabling positive impact, innovation, and growth, while fostering a culture of recognition and appreciation for the efforts of its members.

## Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) program on Optimism

One of the key initiatives within the Optimism ecosystem is the Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) program. This program aims to recognize and reward builders, creators, and educators who have contributed to the development and adoption of Optimism. In its third round, [RetroPGF3](https://round3.optimism.io/) will allocate 30 million OP tokens to those who have made impactful contributions to the community.

[The RetroPGF program](https://www.retropgf.com/) is structured around four categories of contributions: OP Stack, Collective Governance, Developer Ecosystem, and End User Experience & Adoption. This diverse range of categories ensures that various types of contributions, such as enhancing efficiency, security, resilience, governance impact, developer impact, and end-user impact, are all eligible for recognition and reward.

## Participating in RetroPGF

[The process for participating in RetroPGF](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/retropgf-3/) is straightforward. Project applications are submitted within a specified timeframe, followed by a period of voting by badgeholders. The results of the voting lead to the disbursement of tokens to the deserving contributors. This transparent and inclusive process ensures that the community's collective voice is heard, and contributions are recognized and rewarded based on their impact.

Badgeholders play a crucial role in the RetroPGF program by participating in the voting process. These badgeholders are selected through various methods and are entrusted with the responsibility of evaluating and selecting the contributions that have had a significant impact on the Optimism Collective. The use of specialized tools, such as Pairwise for gamifying list creation and OpenSource Observer for analytics on impact metrics, further facilitates the voting process.

RetroPGF is open to all members of the Optimism Collective, including artists, creators, writers, builders, and evangelists. The inclusive nature of the program encourages contributions from a wide range of community members, ensuring that diverse perspectives and talents are recognized and valued within the ecosystem. Furthermore, the program also serves as an inspiration for potential contributors, providing them with examples and ideas for their own impactful contributions to the community.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the Optimism ecosystem and the RetroPGF program exemplify a community-driven approach to recognizing and rewarding impactful contributions. By fostering innovation, collaboration, and inclusivity, the ecosystem continues to grow and evolve while generating positive outcomes for its members. As the RetroPGF program enters its third round, it signifies a continued commitment to nurturing a culture where impact truly equals profit, thereby setting a remarkable example for other communities and ecosystems to follow.

By embracing the principles of recognition, reward, and impact-driven growth, the Optimism Collective is poised to further its mission of creating a thriving and empowered community.
