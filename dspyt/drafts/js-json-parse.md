At its core, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.

When you use JSON.stringify(), it takes a JavaScript object and converts it into a JSON string. This involves traversing the object and converting its properties into strings, following the JSON format rules. For example, it converts JavaScript arrays into JSON arrays and JavaScript objects into JSON objects. It also handles nested structures, arrays, and objects within objects, converting them all into the equivalent JSON representation.

Conversely, when you use JSON.parse(), it takes a JSON string and parses it to produce the corresponding JavaScript object. This process involves examining the string and constructing the corresponding JavaScript data structures, such as arrays and objects, based on the JSON representation.

Under the hood, JavaScript engines utilize algorithms such as recursive tree traversal to efficiently convert between JavaScript objects and JSON strings. They parse and stringify JSON by examining and manipulating the object properties and string characters based on the JSON format's specific syntax and rules.

In essence, JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() are fundamental methods that enable the seamless conversion of data between JavaScript objects and JSON strings, facilitating data interchange and communication between different systems and platforms.
