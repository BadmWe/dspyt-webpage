description: "Decentralized platform that addresses the centralized control over user content by empowering users with ownership and control."
---

PinSave focuses on developing a decentralized content aggregation and image sharing platform where users have ownership of their content, aiming to address the issue of current monolithic web applications retaining ownership of user content and hindering the adoption of decentralized technology.
We believe that empowering users to control not only the content but also the platform itself is essential to promote decentralization and user autonomy in content sharing.
PinSave envisions solving the obstacle of limited content visibility, the complexity in web 3.0 maintenance, and the lack of alternative decentralized content-sharing platforms present in the ecosystem.
It is important to provide users with the capability to create, share, moderate, and discuss decentralized posts securely and openly.
The use of technologies such as JavaScript, NextJS, React, and blockchain networks demonstrates the project's commitment to creating an efficient and decentralized image-sharing platform.

## Target User

The target users of PinSave are individuals who prioritize ownership and control over their content, value privacy, and are enthusiasts of decentralized technology.
They are users who seek a platform where they can securely create, share, and engage with content in a decentralized manner while maintaining ownership and control over their data.
These users are likely interested in exploring alternative platforms that promote decentralization, user autonomy, and transparency in content sharing.
The target users may include content creators, privacy-conscious individuals, blockchain enthusiasts, and users looking for a community-owned and decentralized content-sharing experience.
