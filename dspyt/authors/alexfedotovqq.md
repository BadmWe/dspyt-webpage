 I'm Alexander Fedotov, the mind behind the exciting [TradeCoin](https://trade-coin-xi.vercel.app/) project. I've always been passionate about the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, and it's been an incredible journey that brought me to where I am today.

Employing a diverse skill set encompassing Rust, Solidity, Python, JavaScript, React, and NextJs, I have played a pivotal role in engineering TradeCoin's robust decentralized framework. This endeavor has not gone unnoticed, with accolades from prominent entities like Filecoin, Uniswap, Algorand, Near, Fuel Blockchain, Ceramic, and PARSIQ, underscoring the project's innovative approach and technological sophistication.

As I continue to be an integral part of the TradeCoin project, my dedication remains unwavering, aimed at shaping the future of digital finance and fostering innovation in the blockchain world.
